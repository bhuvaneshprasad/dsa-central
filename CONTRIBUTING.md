## 🤝 How to Contribute
You can contribute by:

1. Adding new data structures or algorithms
2. Solving problems from platforms (e.g. LeetCode, HackerRank)
3. Writing unit tests
4. Improving documentation or folder structure
5. Translating implementations to other languages (Java, JavaScript, Rust)

## 🐞 Opening Issues

- **Found a bug?** Report it using the [bug report template](#).
- **Want to suggest a new data structure/algorithm or problem?** Open an issue to propose it. Be clear and descriptive in your suggestion.

### Is Someone Already Working on This?

- If you plan to work on a specific issue or feature, please **create an issue first** or check if there's already an open issue for the task.
- **Wait for approval or confirmation** from a maintainer or the community before starting significant work to avoid conflicts.
- Once you start working on an issue, make sure to add a comment in the issue thread (e.g., "I'm working on this") so others know it’s in progress.

### How to open an issue:

1. Check if the issue already exists. If not, feel free to create a new one.
2. Use the **"feature request"** template for new features and algorithms or the **"bug report"** template for reporting problems.
3. Include all relevant details in your issue description, including the steps to reproduce (for bugs) or implementation ideas (for features).
